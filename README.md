### Problem: Is this joke funny?
Many online businesses rely on customer reviews and ratings. Explicit feedback is especially important in the entertainment and ecommerce industry where all customer engagements are impacted by these ratings. Netflix relies on such rating data to power its recommendation engine to provide best movie and TV series recommendations that are personalized and most relevant to the user.

This practice problem challenges the participants to predict the ratings for jokes given by the users provided the ratings provided by the same users for another set of jokes. This dataset is taken from the famous jester online Joke Recommender system dataset.
